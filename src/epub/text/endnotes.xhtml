					<p>Annius Verius was his grandfather’s name. There is no verb in this section connected with the word “from,” nor in the following sections of the book: and it is not quite certain what verb should be supplied. What I have added may express the meaning here, though there are sections which it will not fit. If he does not mean to say that he learned all these good things from the several persons whom he mentions, he means that he observed certain good qualities in them, or received certain benefits from them, and it is implied that he was the better for it, or at least might have been: for it would be a mistake to understand Marcus as saying that he possessed all the virtues which he observed in his kinsmen and teachers. <a href="../text/book-1.xhtml#note-1" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>In the works of Justinus there is a printed letter to one Diognetus, whom the writer names “most excellent.”  He was a Gentile, but he wished very much to know what the religion of the Christians was, what God they worshipped, and how this worship made them despise the world and death, and neither believe in the gods of the Greeks nor observe the superstition of the Jews; and what was this love to one another which they had, and why this new kind of religion was introduced now and not before.  My friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jenkins, rector of Lyminge in Kent, has suggested to me that this Diognetus may have been the tutor of <abbr class="name">M.</abbr> Antoninus. <a href="../text/book-1.xhtml#note-5" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>It is not easy to understand this section. It has been suggested that there are some errors in <i xml:lang="el">ηάλόγιδτα</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> some of the translators have made nothing of the passage, and they have somewhat perverted the words. The first proposition is, that the universe was made by some sufficient power. A beginning of the universe is assumed, and a power which framed an order. The next question is, How are things produced now; or, in other words, by what power do forms appear in continuous succession? The answer, according to Antoninus, may be this: It is by virtue of the original constitution of things that all change and succession have been effected and are effected. And this is intelligible in a sense, if we admit that the universe is always one and the same, a continuity of identity; as much one and the same as man is one and the same, which he believes himself to be, though he also believes, and cannot help believing, that both in his body and in his thoughts there is a change and succession. There is no real discontinuity then in the universe; and if we say that there was an order framed in the beginning and that the things which are now produced are a consequence of a previous arrangement, we speak of things as we are compelled to view them, as forming a series or succession; just as we speak of the changes in our own bodies and the sequence of our own thoughts. But as there are no intervals, not even intervals infinitely small, between any two supposed states of any one thing, so there are no intervals, not even infinitely small, between what we call one thing and any other thing which we speak of as immediately preceding or following it. What we call time is an idea derived from our notion of a succession of things or events, an idea which is a part of our constitution, but not an idea which we can suppose to belong to an infinite intelligence and power. The conclusion then is certain that the present and the past, the production of present things and the supposed original order, out of which we say that present things now come, are one; and the preset productive power and the so-called past arrangement are only different names for one thing. I suppose then that Antoninus wrote here as people sometimes talk now, and that his real meaning is not exactly expressed by his words. There are certainly other passages from which, I think, that we may collect that he had notions of production something like what I have expressed.</p>
					<p>We now have come to the alternative: “or even the chief things … principle.” I do not exactly know what he means by <i xml:lang="el">τά κυρώτατα</i>, “the chief,” or “the most excellent,” or whatever it is. But as he speaks elsewhere of inferior and superior things, and of the inferior being for the use of the superior, and of rational beings being the highest, he may here mean rational beings. He also, in this alternative, assumes a governing power of the universe, and that it acts by directing its power toward these chief objects, or making its special, proper, motion toward them. And here he uses the noun (<i xml:lang="el">όρμή</i>) “movement,” which contains the same notion as the verb (<i xml:lang="el">ῶρμηδε</i>) “moved,” which he used at the beginning of the paragraph when he was speaking of the making of the universe. If we do not accept the first hypothesis, he says, we must take the conclusion of the second, that the “chief things toward which the ruling power of the universe directs its own movement are governed by no rational principle.” The meaning then is, if there is no meaning in it, that though there is a governing power, which strives to give effect to its efforts, we must conclude that there is no rational direction of anything, if the power which first made the universe does not in some way govern it still. Besides, if we assume that anything is now produced or now exists without the action of the supreme intelligence, and yet that this intelligence makes an effort to act, we obtain a conclusion which cannot be reconciled with the nature of a supreme power, whose existence Antoninus always assumes. The tranquility that a man may gain from these reflections must result from his rejecting the second hypothesis, and accepting the first; whatever may be the exact sense in which the emperor understood the first. Or, as he says elsewhere, if there is no providence which governs the world, man has at least the power of governing himself according to the constitution of his nature; and so he may be tranquil, if he does the best that he can.</p>
					<p>If there is no error in the passage, it is worth the labor to discover the writer’s exact meaning; for I think that he had a meaning, though people may not agree what it was. (Compare <a href="../text/book-9.xhtml#p-28">Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>, ¶28</a>.)

					<p>The word <i xml:lang="el">πρεσβύτερα</i>, which is here translated “prior,” may also mean “superior”: but Antoninus seems to say that piety and reverence of the gods precede all virtues, and that other virtues are derived from them, even justice, which in another passage (<a href="../text/book-11.xhtml#p-15">¶15</a>) he makes the foundation of all virtues. The ancient notion of justice is that giving to everyone his due. It’s not a legal definition, as some have supposed, but a moral rule which law cannot in all cases enforce. Besides law that has its own rules, which are sometimes moral and sometimes immoral; but it enforces them all simply because they are general rules, and if it did not or could not enforce them, so far Law would not be Law. Justice, or the doing what is just, implies a universal rule and obedience to it; and as well as we all live under universal Law, which commands both our body and our intelligence, and is the law of our nature, that is the law of the whole constitution of man, we must endeavor to discover what this supreme Law is. It is the will of the power that rules all. By acting in obedience to this will, we do justice, and by consequence everything else that we ought to do. <a href="../text/book-11.xhtml#note-109" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Seen even with the eyes.” It is supposed that this may be explained by the Stoic doctrine, that the universe is a god or living being (<a href="../text/book-4.xhtml#p-42">Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, ¶42</a>), and that the celestial bodies are gods (<a href="../text/book-8.xhtml#p-19">Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, ¶19</a>). But the emperor may mean that we know that the gods exist, as he afterwards states it, because we see what they do; as we know that man has intellectual powers, because we see what he does, and in no other way do we know it. This passage then will agree with the passage in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Epistle to the Romans</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span>, 20), and with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Epistle to the Colossians</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span>, 15) in which Jesus Christ is named “the image of the invisible god;” and with the passage in the Gospel of <abbr>St.</abbr> John (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span>, 9).</p>
